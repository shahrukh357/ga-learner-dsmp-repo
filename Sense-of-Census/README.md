### Project Overview

 In this project,we were supposed to find the mean of pay based on income and age .
Differentiate the senior citizen on basis of age and check whether their working hours is as per the government policy.
Tested the hypothesis whether higher education leads to higher income
 


### Learnings from the project

 The major focus was to subset the entire dataset based on a condition specified using np.where method to get the subset.
Doing Several operation like sum,mean and len() etc using numpy(which is amazingly fast)



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 According to the Given Condition,
I used to check the documentation of numpy, where by looking at use cases ,I was able to extract out solution for my project.
Watch some related videos on youtube and refer the notes 


### Challenges faced

 Most of the time I was coding  list comprehension,to go around.
Then I realized that numpy has built in numpy method to do the same thing with much more efficiency.




### Additional pointers

 Refer the documention so that you can minimize the length of code without trading off your speed.
