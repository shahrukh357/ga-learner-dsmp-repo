### Project Overview

 In this Project ,we will be calculating the probability of different columns over other and check whether they are independent or not.and then eventually plot graph of a given probablity condition 


### Learnings from the project

 1)Core concept of probability.
2)How to calculate different type of probability using pandas .
3)Writing logic to check independency of event.
4)calculating Bayes Theorem


 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Made a formula list for probability.
Solved number of examples of probability to get the hang of it.
