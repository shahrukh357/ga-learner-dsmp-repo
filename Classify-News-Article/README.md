### Project Overview

 In this project we will be classifying news article on the basis of their category,for that we will used TFidf,Count Vectorizer,and for modeling will be using MultinomialNB, Logistic Regression, and SVM.


### Learnings from the project

 The concept behind countVectorizer and Tfidf which plays a vital role in modeling and accuracy.
Use  of One_vs_Rest_Classifier in combination of logistic Regression. 



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Following the documentation of respective algorithm.
Understanding the business problem.



### Additional pointers

 Use of SVC with Linear kernel makes a huge difference.
